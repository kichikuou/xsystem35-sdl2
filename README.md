# xsytem35-sdl2

This is a multi-platform port of `xsystem35`, a free implementation of
AliceSoft's System 3.x game engine.

## Compatiblity

See the [game compatibility table](game_compatibility.md) for a list of games
that can be played on xsystem35-sdl2.

## Unique Features

In addition to the original System 3.x's functionalities, xsystem35-sdl2 has
the following features.

### Playing audio files as fake CD music

Many System 3.x games had music as audio tracks on the CD-ROM. Xsystem35 can
play music from audio files instead, to avoid the hassle of inserting CDs. To
use ripped audio files, create a file named `playlist.txt` in the game
directory, and enter the paths to your tracks, one per line. For example:

```
# The first line is not used
BGM/track02.mp3
BGM/track03.mp3
...
```

The first line is not used, because track 1 of game CD is usually a data track.

Some games have the music integrated as MIDI, if this is the case the music won't play using the fake CD.
If this is the case and the music does not play, SDL might need to use the `SDL_SOUNDFONTS` enviroment variable,
set `SDL_SOUNDFONTS` to point to a sf2 file.

```
SDL_SOUNDFONTS=/usr/share/soundfonts/GeneralUser.sf2 xsystem35
```

### Unicode translation support

The original System 3.x only supported Shift_JIS (a Japanese character
encoding), but xsystem35 supports Unicode and is able to run games translated
into languages other than Japanese and English.

See [xsys35c](https://github.com/kichikuou/xsys35c)'s document for how to
build a game with Unicode mode.

### Debugging

Xsystem35 has a built-in debugger that allows you to step through the game and
examine / modify variables in the game. There are two ways to use the debugger:

- Through [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended):
  The [vscode-system3x](https://github.com/kichikuou/vscode-system3x) extension
  provides graphical debugging interface for System 3.x.
- Using CUI debugger: Running xsystem35 with `-debug` option will start the
  debugger with console interface. Type `help` to see a list of available
  commands.

## Installing

Prebuilt packages for Windows and Android can be downloaded from the
[Releases](https://github.com/kichikuou/xsystem35-sdl2/releases) page. For
other platforms, see the [Building](#building) section.

## Running
### Windows

Execute `xsytem35`, and it will show a dialog to select a folder. Select the
game folder (where the ALD files are located).

### Android

See [android/README.md](https://github.com/kichikuou/xsystem35-sdl2/blob/master/android/README.md#use).

### Other Platforms

Run xsystem35 from within the game directory.

    cd /path/to/game_directory
    xsystem35

## Building
### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)
